## What is it?

HTMX is a dependency-free, browser-oriented javascript library.  
It's a library that allows you to access modern browser features directly from HTML, rather than using javascript.  

To install it: https://htmx.org/docs/#installing  

>[!important]
>HTMX does require a server. If you're not familiar with backend development, checkout Dave Gray's Node.js course on youtube.
